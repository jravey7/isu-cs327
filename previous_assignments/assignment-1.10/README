SUMMARY:
This is the tenth build of the rougelike game. This iteration implements
pc ranged combat. The ranged combat can from a ranged weapon (must be
equipped) or magic spell. To attack with a ranged weapon use 'B'. To
attack with the magic spell use 'C'. The magic spell includes an area of
effect that will damage monster in the highlighted box by 150 hitpoints.
The ranged weapon does damage based on the dice rolled for the weapon.
The range of the magic spell is a radius of 5 and the ranged weapon is 
10. Both the magic spell and ranged attack can go through walls or
around corners. Use '2' and '8' to cycle through targets and space bar
to select the target. You can use the provided object_desc.txt to 
include a ranged weapon (Magic Bow) in your runs.
