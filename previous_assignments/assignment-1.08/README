Use make to build the executable and run "./rlg327"

SUMMARY:
This is the eigth build of the rougelike game. This iteration implements
objects from given descriptions. Currently, objects appear in the dungeon
but they can't be used. This build also adds monsters from descriptions.
The objects and monsters are given a color from their description and
rendered as that color in the dungeon. I've taken out fog of war for this
build in order to easily see the objects and monsters in the dungeon.
However, I did implement colors with fog of war, its just not used.

NEW FILES:
object.cpp/.h - the class and functions for instances of objects

NEW DATA STRUCTURES:
Classes: object - holds a an instance of an object
