Assignment 0 for Com Sci 327 by Joe Avey

This folder contains two programs.

assignment0a:
The first program iteratively prints the first 100,000,000 numbers in the hyperbinary integer sequence, b(n) that satisfies
the property that every positive rational appears exactly once as b(n)/b(n+1), where n is >= 0. Usage: assignment0a

assignment0b:
The second program takes an integer, n, and recursively calculates the nth rational number. Usage: assignment0b <n>

Use 'make' to build the binaries.
