Assignment: 1.01

Use make to build the executable and run "./assignment1.01"

SUMMARY:
This is the first build of the rougelike game. The code builds an 84x21 dungeon
with at least 5 rooms and corridors to make the rooms fully connected. The
dungeon is a 2D array of "dungeon_node_t" which is a struct that holds the type
of a dungeon point. It also prints the dungeon to standard output as ASCII
characters.

NEW FILES:
main.c - contains main() and the functions for building a random dungeon

NEW DATA STRUCTURES:
room_t: holds the x and y position of a room and its size

dungeon_node_t:  one point in the dungeon; holds a type (ROOM,ROCK,
CORRDIDOR,IMMUTABLE), and a rock hardness (0 for non-rocks, 1-99 for rocks,
100 for immutable)

point_t: simple struct for a point (x,y)
