Use make to build the executable and run "./assignment1.03"

SUMMARY:
This is the third build of the rougelike game. This iteration prints three maps. 
1) the normally rendered dungeon, 2) a non-tunneling distance map, and
3) a tunneling distance map. This code implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding
the shortest path between two dungeon nodes. Each cell in the distance maps 
represents the distance between that cell and the Player Character (represented as 
'@' in the normal dungeon). The distance is in the range [0,62] with the double 
digit ranges represented as a-z and then A-z.

NEW FILES:
heap(.c/.h) - a library that implements a heap with priority queue capabilities. Given
by Jeremy Sheaffer.
macros.h - added to support the heap library

NEW DATA STRUCTURES:
heap - data structure used to implement a priority queue
vertex_path_t - a struct to represent a series of moves
that make up a path in the dungeon.
