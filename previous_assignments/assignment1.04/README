Use make to build the executable and run "./assignment1.04"

SUMMARY:
This is the fourth build of the rougelike game. This iteration adds monsters. 
The build now runs a mini game that ends when either all monsters are dead 
or the pc is dead. There are 16 types of monsters (0-f) that can take on up 
to four abilities, which are intelligent, telepathic, tunnelling, and 
erratic. Currently, the intelligent monsters behave the same as telepathic,
they both move on the shortest path to the PC and know where the PC is always. 
The tunneling monsters do not move toward the PC, but randomly instead. I was
not able to find time to implement the movement towards the PC without it 
being the shortest path, in other words the straight path.

NEW FILES:
there are no new files this build

NEW DATA STRUCTURES:
character_t - the struct for holding character abilities, their position,
and their status (alive/dead)
