Assignment: 1.02

Use make to build the executable and run "./assignment1.02"

SUMMARY:
This is the second build of the rougelike game. The updated code is now capable of
saving and loading dungeons. Use switch "--save" to save the next built dungeon.
Use switch "--load" to load a dungeon from the file ~/.rlg327/dungeon. Use both
switches to load a dungeon and redudantly save over the dungeon file with the
same dungeon data (used mostly for testing purposes).

NEW FILES:
dungeon.c - main.c had been renamed to dungeon.c. In the future there will be another main.c which will #include headers

NEW DATA STRUCTURES:
(no new data stuctures this build)
